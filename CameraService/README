Microphone service is Java implemented server that controls
audio data stream. Audio packets generated by user's speech
are sent from mobile device connected to service through 
wifi. Received data played by speakers of computer where service
was started.

NOTE : service is working only with Linux. Compatibility with
Windows will be in future.
